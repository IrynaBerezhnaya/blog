# [Simple Blog using WordPress - Setup and Features](http://blog.web-dev.team/)

This guide outlines the setup and features implemented in our WordPress blog, ensuring a seamless user experience for both the admin and the visitors. The blog leverages WordPress, a robust content management system, to create, edit, and manage posts with ease.

## Initial Setup

1. **WordPress Installation:** The website is set up on a server using WordPress as the foundational platform.

2. **Theme Configuration:** We've chosen the Twenty Twenty-Four theme for its modern aesthetics and responsive design, ensuring our blog looks great on all devices.

## Creating a Child Theme or just Clone this Repository

To ensure that your customizations are preserved and not overwritten by theme updates, it's crucial to create a **Child Theme**. This allows you to safely modify styles and functionality:

- **Child Theme Setup:** Create a child theme directory in your WordPress installation and include a `style.css` file with the required header information to identify it as a child of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme. Additionally, create a `functions.php` file to enqueue styles correctly and safely add custom PHP functions.

## Features and Plugins

### User Registration and Management

- **User Registration:** Enabled through WordPress admin panel (Settings -> General -> Membership), allowing anyone to register.
- **Install UsersWP Plugin:** Facilitates user registration and provides a login form, enhancing user interaction with the site.

### Content Submission and Management

- **Install Front User Submit | Front Editor Plugin:** Empowers users to submit blog posts directly from the frontend. This plugin also allows users to edit and delete their posts, comment on posts, and add images, making the content creation process more interactive and user-friendly.

### Categorization and Filtering

- **Category Management:** Categories are added in the admin area, enabling users to classify their posts for better organization and discoverability.
- **Install Category Ajax Filter Plugin:** Implements filtering functionality, allowing users to filter posts by categories dynamically without page reloads.

### Optional Enhancements
